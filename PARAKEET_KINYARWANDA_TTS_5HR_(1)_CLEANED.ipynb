    "Sub-word encoding models are almost nearly identical to the Character encoding models. The primary difference lies in the fact that a sub-encoding model accepts a sub-word tokenized text corpus and emits sub-word tokens in its decoding step. The following section will detail how we prepare a CTC model which utilizes a sub-word Encoding scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, we will utilize a pre-trained [Parakeet Nvidia 0.6b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01721) trained on roughly 7,000 hours of English speech as the base model. We will modify the decoder layer (thereby changing the model's vocabulary) and then train for a small number of epochs."

    "## Prepare Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we update the vocabulary of the model, first, we need to construct a tokenizer. NeMo supports both Word Piece Tokenizer (via HuggingFace) or Sentence Piece Tokenizer (via Google SentencePiece library). We will utilize the SentencePiece tokenizer in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "Preparation of the tokenizer is made simple by the `process_asr_text_tokenizer.py` script in NeMo. We will leverage this script to build the text corpus from the manifest directly, then create a tokenizer using that corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Ordinarily, for languages that have such substantially large vocabularies, there is no significant benefit obtained by constructing sub-word vocabulary. In Natural Language Processing, we could use enormous vocabulary sizes of 10,000+ tokens, but that is unfeasible for CTC loss training of ASR models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will construct a sub-word tokenizer with vocabulary size exactly the same as the character encoding model plus add a few tokens required by SentencePiece required to perform tokenization. You can experiment with the effect of larger vocabularies by editing `VOCAB_SIZE` below."
